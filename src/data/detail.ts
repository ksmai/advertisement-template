  lead: "When P1xt's Guide debuted in 2016 it was a programming curriculum unlike any the world had ever seen. It didn't just change how people learn, but what they thought self-learning could be. But a lot has changed since then, so it made sense that P1xt's Guide should change too.",
  content: "So how did P1xt create one of the most iconic and beloved self learning guides in the world? She reexamined huge amounts of learning materials available on the web in the context of today's learning and technology. With rigorous, intensive learning materials, better organised structure, new project ideas, and a more pragmatic, challenging learning approach, she didn't recreate or redesign the P1xt's Guide\u2014she remastered it. Just as iconic films and albums are updated for new audiences, P1xt's Guide has been remastered to meet the needs of today's learning, learners, and learning environments. By coupling Chingu cohort's vision with eager learners' latest experience around self learning, the new P1xt's Guide works smarter than ever before\u2014so you can too.",
